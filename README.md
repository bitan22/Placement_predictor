# **PLACEMENT PREDICTOR USING MACHINE LEARNING**

The Student Placement Prediction Project is designed to forecast student placements based on key parameters, specifically Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) and Intelligence Quotient (IQ). Employing logistic regression, the model aims to determine whether a student is likely to secure placement or not, achieving a commendable 80% accuracy. To use the project, ensure your dataset includes CGPA, IQ, and a binary placement indicator. Dependencies such as scikit-learn, NumPy, and Pandas should be installed, followed by training the logistic regression model. Prediction on new data is facilitated by inputting CGPA and IQ values.
